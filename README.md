# route-53

Project: Configuring AWS Route 53 with EC2 as the source





Objective:To create an AWS Route 53 with EC2 Instance as the source





-I logged into my AWS management console.




-Navigated to Route 53 services





-Clicked on register domain name (uraffods.com)






-I created aa domain name





-I proceeded to the create a hosted zone for the domain name






-I then went ahead to create an EC2






-I proceeded to create record set.







-I created an A record pointing to the elastic IP of the EC2 instance









-I navigated to the EC2 instance dashboard







-Took not of the elastic IP address of the instance





-I updated the DNS record in the Route 53 hosted zone to point to the elastic IP address






- I opened the browser and entered and entered my domain name






-The browser resolved the domain to the IP address of the EC2






The project gave me an insight into the concept of Route 53and how it can work with the instances








In the process of carrying out this project there were places I got stuck but with the help of the team and the internet, I was able to scale through.
